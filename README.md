# Neural Network Implementation of Lung Disease Classification
This project is created for one of Bangkit Academy's assignments.
## Project Overview
We implemented a Neural Network model to classify lung disease of a patient from their breathing sounds. The dataset was taken from the [Respiratory Sound Database](https://www.kaggle.com/vbookshelf/respiratory-sound-database).
