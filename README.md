# Neural Network Implementation of Lung Disease Classification
This project is created for one of Bangkit Academy's assignments.
## Project Overview
We implemented a Neural Network model to classify lung disease of a patient from their breathing sounds. The dataset was taken from the [Respiratory Sound Database](https://www.kaggle.com/vbookshelf/respiratory-sound-database).
## Running the notebook
You can run the notebook online by using
[Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ngoding/bangkit-project/blob/master/main-notebook.ipynb)
## Testing
Merge your code into `development` branch and run the notebook from [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ngoding/bangkit-project/blob/development/main-notebook.ipynb)
